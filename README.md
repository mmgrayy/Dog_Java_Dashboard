# Project_3-Must-Love-Dogs
Our dog adoption dashboard provides the user with a drop down menu allowing them to choose from a variety of dog breeds. Once a breed is chosen, the dashboard will present the user with a variety of information pulled from the dog API including, dog traits, weight, height, lifespan. 

Our app includes 3 visualizations: 

    Gauge : demonstrates the average lifespan for selected breed using D3.
    Bar chart: demonstrates the  purchase price information using plotly.
    Scatterplot: demonstrates the correlation between breed weight and lifespan using chart.js.
